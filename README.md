# Universal Forecast

live site: [Universal Forecast](https://drawingdash.com/).

## Description

Forecast site made to learn TypeScript and explore how Vite works. I used the [Accuweather API](https://developer.accuweather.com/) to fetch all the data, and replaced their
default icons with animated ones.
